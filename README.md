# thor-io.vnext.ng2.boilerplate

##about

This example is based Dan Wahlins angular2 jump start found on  https://github.com/DanWahlin/Angular2-JumpStart and contains a very simple
chat demo based on thor-io.vnext.  It uses express and express-ws.

Many thanks to Dan for great boiler, and sorry of i messed it up :-)


##Info

Look at /server/index.js and you will get a clue how to set-up thor-io, as well as in /rtccontroller folder you will find
the "backend controller".
